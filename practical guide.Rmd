### Introduction

The aim of this practical is to give you an understanding of the common appraches that are used to process and analyse animal movement data. We will be doing this in the `R` statistical framework and will introduce you to some commonly used `R` packages.

During this practical you will:

1. Load in an example location dataset and explore the data with some preliminary plots
2. Produce a map of the study area in an appropriate spatial projection for the region
3. Load in an example dive summary dataset and explore the data with some preliminary plots
4. Regularise animal location data and combine them with dive summary data
5. Extract example environmental covariates from the regions the animal utilises and append them to the data frame  
6. Perform a preliminary statistical analysis to better understand the drivers of animal movement  

This practical will be based on the `tidyverse` style of `R` coding. You will become familiar with using pipes `%>%` to perform data manipulations, using `ggplot` to generate publication quality figures, and using the `sf` package to handle spatial data.

For more information on the `tidyverse` check out the Wickham & Grolemund book 'R for Data Science'.
You can access it for free online here:  
https://r4ds.had.co.nz

The project website can be accessed here:  
https://www.tidyverse.org

For more information on the `sf` project check out https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/

This practical will require that you have first downloaded and installed the following R packages:
`tidyverse`,
`rnaturalearth`,
`sf`,
`viridis`
`lubridate`
`foieGras`
`marmap`
`raster`...

### Background

In March 2019 I was part of an expedition to deploy SMRU SRDL devices on harp seal pups in the Gulf of St Lawrence, Canada.
Harp seals give birth on the sea ice when it is at it's most southerly extent in late Winter/ early Spring.
The females wean the pups after around 2 weeks, and the pups start to enter the water and feed for themselves approximately 2 weeks after weaning.
We deployed tags on 12 pups that were approximately 3 weeks old, and tracked their movements as they left the sea ice and began their first migration north.

Most of the tags have now stopped transmitting, but you can see a map of the raw unfiltered location data here:  
https://jamesgrecian.shinyapps.io/harpmap/

### Data
  
SMRU Satellite Relay Data Loggers collect a wide range of information and transmit the data through the Argos satellite network.
In this practical we will be considering the location data and the dive summary data.

Data for 6 of these animals are available to you via GitHub, you can load this straight into `R` using the `read_csv` command:
  
`locs <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesgrecian/BL5122-dev/master/data/hp6_diag.csv"))`
`dives <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesgrecian/BL5122-dev/master/data/hp6_summary.csv"))`

The `locs` data frame is the "diag" data from the tags. This has columns containing information on the animal id, the date and time of the fix, the estimated quality of the argos location, the estimated longitude and latitude, as well as information on the error ellipses from the Argos Kalman Filter (a more detailed measure of the location quality). Refer to your lecture notes for more information on this.

The `dives` data frame is the "summary" data from the tags and contains 6 hourly summary information for all the dives performed by an individual.
Some of the information has been truncated for this practical, but there are columns containing the start time of the 6 hour period, the proportion of time an individual spent at the surface, diving, or hauled out, the number of dives finished during the period, the average dive depth, maximum dive depth, average dive duration and maximum dive duration.

For more information on the data collected by the tags see here:  
http://www.smru.st-andrews.ac.uk/protected/specs/DatabaseFieldDescriptions.pdf

### Task 1: Load in example location data and explore {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

#### Task

Use the `read_csv` function from the `tidyverse` series of packages to load the location dataset into R.

You can look at the top 10 rows of the dataframe by typing the object name: `locs`,
you can look at a summary of the dataframe by typing `summary(locs)`.

Generate some preliminary plots to explore the data, try plotting using the `ggplot` command. Have a look at the help file by typing `?ggplot`

If you haven't used `ggplot` before, it is based on "The Grammar of Graphics". Have a look at the tidyverse help page, it has some great cheat sheets: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org

Every plot (even a map) has the same building blocks; a data set, coordinate system, and aesthetics.
For example here is a simple plot of the longitude and latitude data from the tag dataset:

`ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = lon, y = lat), data = locs)`

Use this code to plot the migratory paths of the animals using the `lon` and `lat` column from the SRDL diag data. Try using the `facet_wrap` command to generate seperate plots for each animal (the id column).

Try plotting other parts of the `locs` dataframe, what patterns do you see emerge?

Can you generate a plot to illustrate when the animals begin their northward migration? Try plotting latitude against time.

Can you identify gaps in the data, or poor quality locations due to issues with satellite coverage? Perhaps colour the locations using the `lc` column.

How long do the tags last? Can you generate a summary table? Have a look at `?dplyr::summarise` for some help

#### Code 

```{r message = F, warning = F, echo = T, eval = F}
require(tidyverse)

# load in the data
locs <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesgrecian/BL5122-dev/master/data/hp6_diag.csv"))

locs # check the data

summary(locs) # generate a summary

# lon lat plot coloured by animal id
p1 <- ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = lon, y = lat, colour = id), data = locs) +

```

### Task 2: Produce a map of the study area {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

#### Task

Using the `sf` package alongside `ggplot2` and the `tidyverse` it is possible to generate publication quality maps in R.

You will need to download an appropriate shapefile of the world to add to the map.
Have a look at the `rnaturalearth` package. You can generate a plot of the shapefile using the `geom_sf` function.

Once you had generated a simple map, try adding the animal location data. To do this you will need to add projection information to the location dataframe.

You can do this using the `st_as_sf` and `st_set_crs` commands from `sf`. Latitude and Longitude information is typically referred to as WGS84 or CRS code 4326

For more information have a look at the epsg.io website: https://epsg.io

Harp seals are an Arctic species, so the WGS84 projection means it is hard to see what is going on. We can change the projection of the map to remove some of this distortion.

Think about what projection may be appropriate and try adding it to the plot using the `coord_sf` command.

#### Code 

```{r message = F, warning = F, echo = T, eval = F}
require(sf)
#install.packages("rnaturalearth")
#install.packages("rnaturalearthdata")
require(rnaturalearth)

# Generate a global shapefile and a simple plot
world <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")

p4 <- ggplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_sf(aes(), data = world)
print(p4)

# Create an sf version of the locs data with a WGS84 projection and add to the plot
locs_sf <- locs %>% st_as_sf(coords = c('lon', 'lat')) %>% st_set_crs(4326)

# Add the locations to the WGS map
print(p4 + geom_sf(aes(colour = id), data = locs_sf, show.legend = "point"))

# To generate a plot with less distortion first define a projection i.e. Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area
prj = "+proj=laea +lat_0=60 +lon_0=-50 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0"

p5 <- ggplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_sf(aes(), data = world) +
  coord_sf(crs = prj) +
  geom_sf(aes(colour = id), data = locs_sf, show.legend = "point") +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-2500000, 2500000), ylim = c(-2500000, 2500000), crs = prj, expand = T) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = -130, to = 30, by = 10))
print(p5)

```

### Task 3: Load in an example dive summary dataset and explore {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

#### Task

Load in the dive summary data and generate some preliminary plots to visualise the data.

This data is transmitted via the Argos system, do we have all the 6 hour summary data from all the tags or are there gaps in transmission?

These animals were tagged as newly weaned pups, can you see changes in their diving behaviour over time?

Try plotting different dive parameters as a time series using `ggplot`

#### Code 

```{r message = F, warning = F, echo = T, eval = F}
dives <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesgrecian/BL5122-dev/master/data/hp6_summary.csv"))

#how many dive records do we have?
dives %>% group_by(id) %>% tally()

p6 <- ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = date, y = haul_time/60),
             data = dives %>% filter(date < "2019-06-23")) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = date, y = haul_time/60),
              formula = "y ~ x", method = "loess", span = 0.5,
              data = dives %>% filter(date < "2019-06-23")) +
  facet_wrap(~id, nrow = 3)
print(p6)

```

#### Answer

  geom_smooth(aes(x = date, y = haul_time/60),
              formula = "y ~ x", method = "loess", span = 0.5,
              data = dives %>% filter(date < "2019-06-23")) +
  facet_wrap(~id, nrow = 3)
print(p6)

```

### Task 4: Regularise location data and combine with dive summary data {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

#### Task

If we want to explore how the dive behaviour of these animals changes as they migrate we need to link the surface movements to the dive summary data.

However, if you look at the time stamps of both the datasets they do not match:  
`head(locs$date)`  
`head(dives$date)`  

This is because, while the dive data are summarised regularly, the location data are only collected when a satellite passes overhead and the animal is at the surface.  

It is common practice to remove erroneous fixes and regularise the location data before conducting statistical analysis. We can do this using a type of state space model known as a random walk filter.

This can be fitted very quickly using the new foieGras package.
Have a look at the help file by typing `browseVignettes(package = "foieGras")`

You will need to generate a sequence of times that you want the model to estimate locations for. Add these to the `time.step` argument in the `fit_ssm` command.

Once you have run the model (which will take a few minutes), extract the predicted locations using the `grab` command.

This should give you a table of locations that match the time stamps in the dive data. Combine the columns from these two datasets using the `left_join` command. The output should be a dataframe containing animal id, datetime, lon, lat and the dive summary data.

#### Code
```{r message = F, warning = F, echo = T, eval = F}
require(lubridate)
require(foieGras)

# Create a regular series of datetimes that can be matched to the dive data
# These will be at 6 hour intervals starting at midnight
times <- locs %>% group_by(id) %>% summarise(min = floor_date(min(locs$date), "6 hours"),
                                             max = ceiling_date(max(locs$date), "6 hours")) %>%
  mutate(date = map2(min, max, seq, by = "6 hours")) %>% # Create a list column with dates
  unnest() %>%
  select(id, date)

# Regularise the location data to match the 6 hour dive summary data 
# Fit a continuous time random walk using the Argos least squares data
fit <- fit_ssm(locs, model = "rw", time.step = times)

# Extract fitted values from model
plocs <- grab(fit, "predicted", as_sf = F)

# combine regularised locations with dive data
dat <- left_join(plocs, dives, by = c("id" = "id", "date" = "date"))
print(dat)

```

#### Answer

```{r message = F, warning = F, echo = F, eval = T}
require(lubridate)
require(foieGras)

# Create a regular series of datetimes that can be matched to the dive data
# These will be at 6 hour intervals starting at midnight
times <- locs %>% group_by(id) %>% summarise(min = floor_date(min(locs$date), "6 hours"),
                                             max = ceiling_date(max(locs$date), "6 hours")) %>%
  mutate(date = map2(min, max, seq, by = "6 hours")) %>% # Create a list column with dates
  unnest() %>%
  select(id, date)

# Regularise the location data to match the 6 hour dive summary data 
# Fit a continuous time random walk using the Argos least squares data
fit <- fit_ssm(locs, model = "rw", time.step = times)

# Extract fitted values from model
plocs <- grab(fit, "predicted", as_sf = F)

# combine regularised locations with dive data
dat <- left_join(plocs, dives, by = c("id" = "id", "date" = "date"))
print(dat)

```

### Task 5: Extract environmental covariates and append to dataframe {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

#### Task

Now that we have a regularised dataset with location and dive information, we can extract some environmental data to allow us to explore the drivers of movement.

The `marmap` package contains a function to download global bathymetry data from the ETOPO1 global relief model at up to 1 minute (~1.8 km) resolution.

Have a look at the `getNOAA.bathy` function. You will need to supply the coordinates of the bounding box you want data for, and the resolution you need. The bounding box information can be taken from the location dataframe that you generated as part of Task 2, have a look at the `st_bbox` function.

Once you have downloaded the data, to generate a nice plot of the bathymetry data using ggplot, you will need to convert it to a raster object, project it to your chosen projection, and then convert it to a dataframe. Have a look at the `projectRaster`, `rasterToPoints` and `geom_raster` functions.

Finally, we need to append geolocated bathymetry data to the animal movement dataframe. We can do this using the `extract` function in the `raster` package.

#### Code
```{r message = F, warning = F, echo = T, eval = F}
#Download bathymetry data from ETOPO1 database hosted on the NOAA website
#install.packages("marmap")
require(marmap)
bathy <- getNOAA.bathy(lon1 = st_bbox(locs_sf)[1],
                       lon2 = st_bbox(locs_sf)[3],
                       lat1 = st_bbox(locs_sf)[2],
                       lat2 = st_bbox(locs_sf)[4], resolution = 5)
bat = marmap::as.raster(bathy)

# Define a projection and transform bathymetry data
r = raster::projectRaster(bat, crs = sp::CRS(prj), method = 'ngb', res = 10000)
bat_df = as.data.frame(raster::rasterToPoints(r))
names(bat_df) = c("x", "y", "depth")

p7 <- ggplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_raster(aes(x = x, y = y, fill = depth), data = bat_df) +
  geom_sf(aes(), data = world) +
  geom_sf(aes(colour = id), data = locs_sf, show.legend = "point") +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-2500000, 2500000), ylim = c(-2500000, 2500000), crs = prj, expand = T) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = -130, to = 30, by = 10)) + 
  xlab("") + ylab("")
print(p7)

#Extract the bathymetry underlying each point
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(bathy = raster::extract(bat, as.matrix(dat[c("lon", "lat")])))
dat

```

### Task 6: Examine the drivers of movement {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

#### Task

The data frame you have now generated and familiarised yourself with is the type that movement ecologists will often create when analysing their data. In this next tast I'm going to get you to examine how the behaviour of the animal changes over the migration, and to see how this may be linked to the localised bathymetry.

In the lecture I talked about "move persistence" as a measure of animal behaviour, and how it can be useful to identify periods of residencey and periods of migratory behavior.

Using the `foieGras` package have a look at the `fit_mpm` function and use it to estimate the move persistence of each individual.

Once you have run a model, try replotting your map of the animal movements but with the locations coloured by the behaviour `g`.  

Finally, try plotting move persistence against bathymetry to examine how behaviour may change in response to the environment.

#### Code
```{r message = F, warning = F, echo = T, eval = F}

# Fit the move persistence model to the data
fmpm <- fit_mpm(dat, model = "jmpm")

# Extract fitted states from model
fmpm_g <- grab(fmpm, "fitted", as_sf = F)

# Combine the behaviour with the dataframe
dat <- left_join(dat, fmpm_g, by = c("id" = "id", "date" = "date"))
print(dat)

# Generate a map coloured by the states
p8 <- ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = lon, y = lat, colour = g), data = dat) +
  facet_wrap(~id)
print(p8)

p9 <- ggplot() +
  geom_ppoint(aes(x = bathy, y = g), data = dat)

```

#### Answer

```{r message = F, warning = F, echo = F, eval = T}
# Fit the move persistence model to the data
fmpm <- fit_mpm(dat, model = "jmpm")

# Extract fitted states from model
fmpm_g <- grab(fmpm, "fitted", as_sf = F)

# Combine the behaviour with the dataframe
dat <- left_join(dat, fmpm_g, by = c("id" = "id", "date" = "date"))
print(dat)

# Generate a map coloured by the states
p8 <- ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = lon, y = lat, colour = g), data = dat) +
  facet_wrap(~id)
print(p8)

p9 <- ggplot() +
  geom_ppoint(aes(x = bathy, y = g), data = dat)

```
